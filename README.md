=== Initial documentation ===

"The moon's an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun."

-William Shakespeare, *Timon of Athens*



"月に代わってお仕置きよ!"

-Usagi Tsukino, *Sailor Moon*



" One cannot help recalling a passage in Timon of Athens (Act IV, Scene 3) where the misanthrope talks to the three marauders. Having no library in the desolate log cabin where I live like Timon in his cave, I am compelled for the purpose of quick citation to retranslate this passage into English prose from a Zemblan poetical version of Timon which, I hope, sufficiently approximates the text, or is at least faithful to its spirit:

  The sun is a thief: she lures the sea

  and robs it. The moon is a thief:

  he steals his silvery light from the sun.

  The sea is a thief: it dissolves the moon.

  For a prudent appraisal of Conmal's translations of Shakespeare's works, see note to line 962."

-Vladimir Nabokov, *Pale Fire*


=== Declaration of Intent ===

The Luna family of package wrappers is intended to be a well-documented and easy-to-use
family of libraries for newer and lower-skilled Haskeller, helping bridge the gap
between academic or textbook study of Haskell and making useful and productive programs.
